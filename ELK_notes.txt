# What is the ELK stack?
- a stack that comprises of three popular projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 

- E = Elasticsearch: search engine
a distributed search and analytics engine

- L = Logstash: receive, transform and send the data to ElasticSearch
Data ingestion tool that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it, and send it to your desired destination.

- K = Kibana: Data visualization tool for logs and events
Has interactive charts, pre-built aggregations and filters, and geospatial support.

# Why is the ELK stack so popular?
- monitor the infrastructure as well as process any server logs, application logs, and clickstreams. 
- log analysis for developers and DevOps 
- failure diagnosis, application performance, and infrastructure monitoring

# Amazon OpenSearch Service 
- support for 19 versions of Elasticsearch (1.5 to 7.10 versions), and visualization capabilities powered by OpenSearch Dashboards and Kibana (1.5 to 7.10 versions). 
- service integrates with Logstash

# NODES:
- MASTER: cluster management
- DATA: store data
- CLIENT: like a load balancer for processing rquests

# Install ELK manually on server:
1. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
2. sudo apt-get install default-jre -y
3. java -version
4. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html
5. sudo apt install elasticsearch
	- sudo systemctl deamon-reload
	- sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
	- sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
	- curl http://localhost:9200
6. sudo apt install logstash
7. sudo apt install kibana
  - nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
    - add server.host: "0.0.0.0"
    - add elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  - sudo service kibana start
  - sudo service kibana status
 - check on browser: <publicIP>:<port(5601)> 
  
# METRICBEAT
- collects metrics from the OS of the server and send it to ElastiSearch or LogStash
- sudo apt install metricbeat
- sudo service metricbeat start
- sudo service metricbeat status
- see the index in ElasticSearch localhost in: Stack Management > Index Management
- create an Index Pattern: Stack Management > Index Patterns > Create Index Pattern
	> copy/paste the index name created
	> Timestamp: @timestamp
	> Create Index Pattern
- Discover: see the logs

# Logstash conf:
- nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/apache.conf
input {
 file {
 path = "/home/ubuntu/apache-daily-access.log"
 start_position = "beginning"
 sincedb_path = "/dev/null"
 }
}
filter {
 grok {
  match = { "message" = "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
 }
 date {
  match = [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z" ]
 }
 geoip {
  source = "clientip"
 }
}
output {
 elasticsearch {
  hosts = ["localhost:9200"]
 }
}
- sudo service logstash start
- sudo service logstash status

# AWS Route 53
- DNS - Domain Name System 
- "A" record map a name to an IP
- "CNAME" record map a name to another name (Main-domain to Sub-domain)
