# There are seven core principles that can help you achieve a DevOps culture.

Create a highly collaborative environment
–
DevOps brings together development and operations to break down silos, align goals, and deliver on common objectives. The whole team (development, testing, security, operations, and others) has end-to-end ownership for the software they release. They work together to optimize the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations. Teams learn from each other's experiences, listen to concerns and perspectives, and streamline their processes to achieve the required results.
This increased visibility enables processes to be unified and continuously improved to deliver on business goals. The collaboration also creates a high-trust culture that values the efforts of each team member, and transfers knowledge and best practices across teams and the organization.

Automate when possible
–
With DevOps, repeatable tasks are automated, enabling teams to focus on innovation. Automation provides the means to rapid development, testing, and deployment. Identify automation opportunities at every phase, such as code integrations, reviews, testing, security, deployments, and monitoring, using the right tools and services.
For example, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) can be used for predefined or approved environments, and versioned so that repeatable and consistent environments are built. You can also define regulatory checks and incorporate them in test that continuously run as part of your release pipeline.

Focus on customer needs
–
A customer first mindset is a key factor in driving development. For example, with feedback loops DevOps teams stay in-touch with their customer and develop software that meets the customer needs. With a microservices architecture, they are able to quickly switch direction and align their efforts to those needs. 
Streamlined processes and automation deliver requested updates faster and keep customer satisfaction high. Monitoring helps teams determine the success of their application and continuously align their customer focused efforts.

Develop small and release often
–
Applications are no longer being developed as one monolithic system with rigid development, testing, and deployment practices. Application architectures are designed with smaller, loosely coupled components. Overarching policies (such as backward compatibility, or change management) are in place and provide governance to development efforts. Teams are organized to match the required system architecture. They have a sense of ownership for their efforts. 
Adopting modern development practices, such as small and frequent code releases, gives teams the agility they need to be responsive to customer needs and business objectives.

Include security at every phase
–
To support continuous delivery, security must be iterative, incremental, automated, and in every phase of the application lifecycle, instead of something that is done before a release. Educate the development and operations teams to embed security into each step of the application lifecycle. This way, you can identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities before they become major issues and are more expensive to fix. 
For example, you can include security testing to scan for hard-coded access keys, or usage of restricted ports.

Continuously experiment and learn
–
Inquiry, innovation, learning, and mentoring are encouraged and incorporated into DevOps processes. Teams are innovative and their progress is monitored. With innovation, failure will happen. Leadership accepts failure and teams are encouraged to see failure as a learning opportunity. 
For example, teams use DevOps tools to spin-up environments on demand, enabling them to experiment and innovate, perhaps on the use of new technology to support a customer requirement.

Continuously improve
–
Thoughtful metrics help teams monitor their progress, evaluate their processes and tools, and work toward common goals and continuous improvement. For example, teams strive to improve development performance measures such as throughput.
They also strive to increase stability and reduce the mean time to restore service. Using the right monitoring tools, you can set application benchmarks for usual behaviors, and continuously monitor for variations.

# DevOps Practices

DevOps culture leads to DevOps practices that are geared toward streamlining and improving the development lifecycle, to reliably deliver frequent updates, while maintaining stability. 

Communication and collaboration
–
DevOps teams set strong cultural norms around transparency of information and communication. These cross-functional teams have ownership and thus, instead of evaluating just their work, they consider the project needs collectively. They build empathy for each other’s efforts, partnerships, and trust, while collaborating towards common goals. They physically bring together traditional development and operations workflows and systematically improve productivity. 
DevOps tools and automation of the delivery process, support these consolidated processes and workflows, coordinate efforts, automate repetitive tasks, and facilitate feedback loops required in good communication and collaboration.

Monitoring and observability
–
Monitoring and observability are used to assess how effective changes to the application and infrastructure are, and how they impact performance and overall user experience. Part of DevOps feedback loops, monitoring and observability help teams react, learn, plan, and improve.
An observable system is a system that generates enough data from all resources, applications, and services in the form of logs, metrics, and traces to gain system-wide operational visibility. Logs report on discrete events, such as warnings. Metrics capture health and performance information, such as request rate or response time. Traces report on transactions and the flow of data across a distributed system, such as one comprised of microservices. 
By observing a system, you can draw concise inferences about why something is happening.
Monitoring tells you what is happening with your system. By consolidating and visualizing data gathered by an observable system over time, teams gain insight on performance, identify trends, can set alarms, and make predictions on expected outcomes.

Continuous integration (CI)
–
Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. This way, teams can resolve merging issues and code defects early, when they are easier and more cost effective to resolve.
Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process. It requires both an automation component (for example, a CI or build service) and a cultural component (for example, learning to integrate frequently). The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

Continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CD)
–
Continuous delivery is a software development practice where every code change is automatically built, tested, and then deployed to a non-production testing or staging environment. Manual approval is required before pushing to production. When properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.
Continuous deployment is similar to continuous delivery, but with automatic deployment to production. Tested code does not need an explicit approval before being pushed to production.

Microservices architecture
–
A microservices architecture, is a design approach that builds an application as a set of loosely coupled services. Each service is designed for a set of capabilities and focuses on solving a specific business problem. Services do not need to share any of their code or implementation with other services. Any communication between individual components happens via well-defined APIs. These services can be assigned to fully accountable teams, and be developed, tested, an deployed independently of other services.
According to research from DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), the type of architecture the team settles on, is a direct predictor of how successful they will be with achieving continuous delivery. The nature of microservices supports faster development, updates and corrections, and quicker deployments.

Infrastructure as code
–
Development, testing, and production run on complex environments comprised of hardware and software. Manually spinning up and setting environments does not scale and is error prone. 
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration.
The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically, and at scale, instead of needing to manually set up and configure resources. Because environments are defined by code, they can quickly be deployed with dynamically enforced compliance, updated with the latest patches, rolled back to a previous version, or duplicated in repeatable ways. Also, by reacting to environment changes through modification to this code, you can track changes, optimize resources, and improve system uptime. 
A DevOps pipeline is a set of stages that move code from source, all the way to deployment. The graphic that follows depicts typical stages in a DevOps pipeline and depicts the phases involved in a CI/CD pipeline.

# DevOps Tools

Cloud
–
Development teams need to quickly innovate and deliver reliable and secure applications. Teams rely on cloud platform providers and cloud computing resources for an array of technologies to support application development efforts. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, teams provision environments on demand, using cloud providers like AWS.

Development
–
DevOps teams need to continuously collaborate with their team members. There are several tools that help teams develop and deliver faster. Integrated development environments (IDEs) help you write, run, and debug code for your applications. Software development kits (SDKs) are sets of tools that allow programmers to develop applications for a specific platform. Source code repositories, or version control systems, store the files of your project. 
As needed, you can access your documents and code, see revision history, compare changes over time, or revert to previous versions.
Examples: 
IDEs: AWS Cloud9, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code
SDKs: AWS SDK for Java, iPhone SDK
Source code repositories: GitHub, AWS CodeCommit

CI/CD
–
Practices such as continuous testing, continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) are supported by tools that bring seamless continuity in all the development phases. CI/CD tools automate continuously integrated code that teams develop, check compliance with standards, run testing more frequently, promote code to different test environments, and deploy products to the infrastructure, repeatedly and reliably. 

CI/CD tools should help bring agility to the application development and deployment processes, while continuously providing feedback and alerting appropriate teams of any issues.
Examples: 
Build tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, AWS CodeBuild
Source control tools, repositories: Git, AWS CodeCommit
Deployment tools: AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CloudFormation
Pipeline automation tools: AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitLab

Infrastructure automation
–
Programmatically define your infrastructure, including constraints, to repeatedly and consistently provision your environments (development sandboxes, testing, staging, production). 
Using templates, you can deploy compute services, permissions, dependencies, and more. You can configure rules and automate remediation.
Examples: 
Infrastructure automation tools: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Configuration management tools: Chef, Puppet, AWS OpsWorks

Containers and serverless
–
Containers and serverless compute services enable the developers to focus on applications, and not on the details of the host environment.
Containers package code, configuration settings, and dependencies needed to run the application. This way, the application is portable and can run on any server. Containers are similar to virtual machines, but more lightweight because they are virtualized at the operating system (OS) level. Containers run anything from microservices to legacy large applications. They streamline the way you build, test, and deploy applications to multiple environments.
They make the deployed application more secure because security policies can be implemented at the container level. Containers however, require container orchestration for managing or scheduling the work of individual containers.
Serverless compute services are services that allow you to build and run code, and let the infrastructure overhead be managed by the service's cloud provider, like AWS. 
Examples: 
Serverless services: AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate
Container services:
Runtimes: Docker, Containerd
Orchestration: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Kubernetes, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

Monitoring and observability
–
Monitoring and observability are key aspects of DevOps, helping you be proactive in preventing challenges before they occur. With tools, you can collect metrics on the health and performance of your application. You can capture deployment frequency, identify successful or failed deployments, application usage traffic, and more. 
Tools can help you trace end-to-end request and transaction flows through a distributed system. With tools, you can visualize and analyze logs, metrics, and traces to uncover new insights on the health, performance, and availability of your system. With insight you can streamline your processes, improve system performance, and reduce downtime. 
Examples: AWS X-Ray, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail

# Lesson 19
AWS DevOps Tools

The following diagram depicts a DevOps pipeline built with some of the AWS services that support those phases. The pipeline starts when a developer checks in code.

Containers and serverless services
–
AWS offers a number of services that support development efforts and enhance your pipeline, including:

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you write code and run it when it gets invoked. With Lambda functions, you can customize your CI/CD pipeline. For example, you can approve release actions, halt the release flow, and control traffic flow during deployments, and more. 

Amazon Elastic Container service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers. It enables you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale container management software.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources. With CloudWatch, you can track resources and application performance, collect and monitor log files, troubleshoot, and set alarm notifications.
