### AWS Overview

# Concept of AWS

- Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- AWS Cloud is used with or instead Hardware.

- Easier to maintain, scale and manage.

- Six advantages of cloud computing" 
	- Trade fixed expense for variable expense.
	- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
	- Access as much or as little capacity as you need.
	- Increase speed and agility.
	- No heavy and expensive hardware needed.
	- Go global in minutes

# Cloud computing models:
	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): for cloud IT, provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS): removes the need to manage the infrastructure (hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management.
	- Software as a Service (SaaS): avoid service maintainance to think how to use your software. (examlpe: web-based email which you can use without having to manage the service).
	
# Global infrastructure:
	- The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones
	- An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones. 
	- Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

# Security:
	- Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. 
	- AWS builds security into the core of our cloud infrastructure, and offers foundational services to help organizations meet their unique security requirements in the cloud.
	- As an AWS customer, you will benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.
	- Benefits: 
		- Keep Your data safe.
		- Meet compliance requirements.
		- Save money.
		- Scale quickly.
		
# Compliance:
	- AWS Cloud Compliance helps you understand the robust controls in place at AWS for security and data protection in the cloud. 
	- Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

# Amazon Web Services Cloud:
	- AWS consists of many cloud services that you can use.
	- To access the services, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or Software Development Kits (SDKs).
	- List of Services by category: Analytics, Application Integration, AR and VR, Blockchain, Business Applications, Cloud Financial Management, etc.
	- Compute Services category: includes EC2, Lambda, etc.
	- Networking and Content Delivery category: includes VPC, ELB (Elastic Load Balancing), Route 53, VPN, etc.
